## Why here?
A while ago, reddit mods deleted this post because it was too helpful, so I'm posting it here.

## Notes:
- If you have a medical condition, seek advice from a physical therapist, not online
- This takes ~30 minutes every three days (e.g. Mon, Thu, Sun)
- Each stretch / exercise takes only 1 minute
- Every stretch / exercise targets key muscle groups for lower back health
- If you need to, reduce the hold times / increase the rest times
- My lower back feels amazing after this; if you have any pain, stop
- If you try it out, let me know what you think!
- Focus on good form

## 5 Stretch Circuit: 20s rests, 2 sets:
- Supine spinal twist (30s left, 30s right)
- Knee-to-chest stretch (30s left, 30s right)
- Seated forward fold (30s forward, 15s to the left of the left foot, 15s to the right of the right foot)
- Low lunges (30s left, 30s right)
- Standing quadriceps stretch (30s left, 30s right)

## 5 Exercise Circuit: 30s rests, 2 sets:
- Isometric single-leg glute bridges (30s left, 30s right)
- Isometric dead bugs (30s left, 30s right)
- Isometric bird-dogs (30s left, 30s right)
- Side planks (30s left, 30s right)
- Isometric clam shell hold (30s left, 30s right)
